  Greetings #{@player},

  I wonder if this documentation finds you well?
  I do hope that you will put forth a great effort to win this year's illustrious
  #{emphasis('DISC-O-RAMA DANCE BATTLE MASTERS CHAMPIONSHIP')}, an honor I could not achieve myself.
  (Oh, the ravages of time!)

  Please remember that I have refactored your navigation module into four easy commands: #{highlight('north, east, south, west')}.
  You may also find #{highlight('look')}, #{highlight('talk')}, and #{highlight('take')} to be brillantly useful for interacting with others.
  If you find yourself needing to take a tea break or the like, do use #{highlight('exit')} to 'bow' out of the competition.
  (I do amuse myself with such wordplay!)

  In good health and happy feet,
  Your friend,

  #{emphasis('the professor')}
