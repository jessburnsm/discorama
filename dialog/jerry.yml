  How do you know #{name}'s name is #{name}? He happens to be wearing a HELLO MY NAME IS '#{name}' tag.

  #{name}: Hey-o disc-o amig-o! The name's #{name} and I'm the coolest cat at the club *wink*.
  -- You highly doubt that is a true statement.

  #{name}: Did you come to compete against the #{@game_text.emphasis('elite feet')} in the competition? Right on, robo-man!

  The #{@game_text.emphasis('elite feet')} is a dancing squad of 5 members that have dominated the dancing competition for the past 5 years.
  Beating them would undeniably prove your #{@game_text.emphasis('Dancing Superiority')}.
