:dance_failure: |
  #{@game_text.player} attempts to do the robot, but looks too human! Embarrassing!
  #{@game_text.player} tries the electric slide, but forgets the 'boogie woogie woogie' part. Disaster!

:dance_failure_result: "#{@opponent.name} takes no damage from #{@game_text.player}'s feeble dance attempt."
