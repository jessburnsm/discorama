  How do you know #{name}'s name is #{name}? He happens to be wearing a
  HELLO MY NAME IS '#{name}' tag. It clashes tragically with his outfit.

  Despite his poor fashion sense, he looks like a #{emphasis('non-threat')}.

:take: |
  As it turns out, forcibly abducting #{emphasis('HUMANS')} is no longer acceptable in polite
  society. ...Even if they have abysmal fashion sense.

:talk: |
  #{name}: Look, look! It's #{player}! It's so good to see you, my friend!

  The word 'friend' was used by #{name}, but you have never met before. Odd.

  #{name}: You're here for the dance battle, right? Woo, 3017 is going to be
  a tough year, friend. The #{emphasis('ELITE FEET')} are already here and boy do
  they look sharp! Wow! If you need any tips, don't be afraid to ask for #{highlight('help')}.
  It can be really handy, you know?

  #{name} waggles his eyebrows in a way you do not know how to interpret.

  #{name}: You'd better get out there friend, if you want to win!

:talk_2: |
  #{name}: What's that, friend? You want to practice a little before you hit the
  floor?

  You are not certain how you implied that.

  #{name}: No problem, friend! READY. SET. DANCE!!!!
