  #{@game_text.discorama} is one of the most popular attractions in New Atlanta,
  as it is one of the only buildings that survived the #{@game_text.emphasis('Robot Revolution')} of 2080.
  (Undergound Atlanta also survived, but no one goes there, so whatever).

  When (old) Atlanta burned to the ground, this club remained open and accepted
  all patrons, both #{@game_text.emphasis('human')} and #{@game_text.emphasis('robotic')}.

  Your auditory receptors are registering music from the dancefloor, to the #{@game_text.highlight('south')}.
  Bathrooms are accessible from the entrance as well, to the #{@game_text.highlight('east')} and #{@game_text.highlight('west')}.

:talk: |
  You begin to sing your favorite song, 'Daisy Bell'. The #{@game_text.emphasis('humans')} in the room look mildly alarmed.
  When you finish, the #{@game_text.emphasis('humans')}, give you polite applause and avoid eye contact.
